                        <h2>Your Will - The Basics</h2>
                        <p>Last Will and Testament

                            Last – “Most recent”
                            Will – “Intentions, desires, wishes”
                            Testament – “Something that serves as a sign or evidence of something else”

                            Your Last Will and Testament is therefore your … most recent … evidence of … your wishes. It is a document that proves to the rest of the world what you want to happen to the assets that you own when you die.
                        </p>
                        <h2>You Can Make A Will Yourself</h2>
                        <p>It is possible for you to make your Will yourself. You can write it on the back of a cereal packet if you want – as long as it is signed and witnessed correctly, and depending on what you have written, it potentially could be a legally valid Will. As a slight step-up in quality, you could purchase a DIY Will kit. This will give you some guidance as to what the Will should contain.

                            Before taking this route, consider whether taking a “cheap” option of the self-made Will is the right action for everything you have worked for all your life. Considering how relatively inexpensive it is to get your Will professionally made with expert guidance, there is very little reason not to get some help.

                            Look at the shoes on your feet right now. You could make them yourself if you really wanted to. But if you did, I imagine (unless you are an expert cobbler) that the shoes you would produce would not be nearly as good as the ones you are wearing. It would take you a long time. You would get stuck along the way and would probably give up. Or you could do what you did do – you went to the marketplace and bought a pair that had been professionally produced.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Step by Step Guide</h2>
                        <p>The real question is – is your Will going to be written in a way that makes best use of a very powerful document? There are many ways that a Will can be used to help your family at a time when they really need as much help as they can get. Your Will can bring your family together, or if written badly can completely destroy the harmony of your family.

                            You really should take professional advice when drawing up your Will. However, if you insist on writing it yourself, then read the government's brief outline of writing your Will [click here]. Here is a brief guide that covers matters not included in the government's guide.

                            1.   	Before putting pen to paper, start by taking a look at the purpose of your Will. What do you want it to achieve? This is a very broad overview of your goal. For example, "I want to make sure everything is in order when I die." Or "I want to make sure my child has guardians appointed just in case I die before she is grown up." Or "I want to make sure my property gets to my kids." Now get your pen out and jot down your goal.
                            2.   	What is your current situation? Write down a list of your close family – parents, siblings, children and grandchildren. This list needs to include all people featured in these categories, even if you do not intend to leave them anything in the Will.
                            3.   	Now list the assets you own. Don't forget life insurances, death in service benefits, shares, savings, items of unusual value, property, vehicles, cash and bank accounts. Then list your debts. Finally, calculate the sum total of your wealth on death.
                            4.   	With the previous steps done, you should now be in the right frame of mind to continue with the steps given in the government's guide, and will be giving due consideration to the important aspects of your situation.

                            Again – there is no substitute for getting professional help. We would love to be of service to you – it is our job and we are very good at what we do.</p>
